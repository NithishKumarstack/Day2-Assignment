Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects?

Introduction:
In the realm of JavaScript, both the `document` and `window` objects play pivotal roles in interacting with the web page and its
environment. While they are closely related and share some similarities, it's important to understand their distinctions to
harness their full potential. In this blog post, we will delve into the differences between the `document` and `window` objects and
explore their unique functionalities.

The `document` Object:
The `document` object represents the current web page loaded in the browser window. It serves as an interface to access and
manipulate the various elements within the document, such as HTML elements, CSS styles, and DOM (Document Object Model) nodes.
The `document` object provides a wide range of properties and methods to traverse and modify the structure and content of the web
page, making it a vital tool for dynamic web development.

The `window` Object:
On the other hand, the `window` object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page. It serves as the global
object in the browser environment and provides access to numerous properties and methods related to the window itself, as well as
its inner components. The `window` object allows you to control the behavior of the browser window, interact with the browser's
history, manage timers and intervals, handle events, and more.

Relationship between `document` and `window`:
The `document` object is a property of the `window` object. It can be accessed using `window.document` or simply `document`.
The `window` object acts as a container for the `document` object, providing a global scope for accessing and manipulating the
document's content. In essence, the `window` object encapsulates the entire browser window and its associated functionality, while
the `document` object represents the specific web page loaded within that window.

Scope and Accessibility:
While both objects are accessible globally, there are subtle differences in their scopes. The `window` object is truly global and
accessible throughout the entire JavaScript environment within the browser, including frames and iframes. On the other hand, the 
`document` object is limited to the specific web page it represents. It can only be accessed within the context of the loaded 
document and is not available outside of that scope.

Functionality and Usage:
The `document` object primarily focuses on manipulating and interacting with the content and structure of the web page. It provides
methods to retrieve and modify elements, create new elements dynamically, manipulate styles, handle events, and perform various
DOM-related operations. The `window` object, on the other hand, deals with the broader browser environment. It offers methods for
controlling window behavior, opening and closing windows, navigating history, managing timers, and handling browser events.

Conclusion:
In JavaScript, the `document` and `window` objects serve distinct purposes within the web browsing environment. While the
`document` object focuses on the specific web page, allowing access and manipulation of its content and structure, the `window`
object encapsulates the entire browser window and provides a gateway to control its behavior and interact with the broader browser
environment. Understanding the differences between these two objects enables developers to effectively leverage their
functionalities and build dynamic and interactive webÂ applications.
